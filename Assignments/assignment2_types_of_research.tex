Example: ``Humanoid robot localisation using stereo vision'',
\url{http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs\_all.jsp?arnumber=1573539}.
This research is about implementing humanoid robot localisation by means of
stereo vision. Stereo vision has previously been used for localisation of
wheeled robots, but poses additional challenges for humanoids due to the jerky
motions generated by humanoid locomotion.
This is design research because it makes use of previously developed methods for
localisation, but applies them to a new domain (humanoid robots instead of
wheeled ones).

The conclusion is that the approach works, but is very noisy and will require
more computationally intensive or accurate methods for practical tasks such as
footstep planning.
